#### *About me:*
Flutter and Frontend developer. I love making cool visual stuff and refactoring my old code.
In development I like to see results, create beautiful, user-friendly ui.
Creating new products inspires me. During my internship at ENVX I worked in a team of 5 people in the roles of tester and flutter-trainee. I gained experience in code review, learned how to work on features in one repository in a project. In my spare time I run an Instagram blog, play chess, basketball and soccer, skateboard, and spend time with my loved ones. And of course with my cats!

#### *English:*
I love practicing English, last year I talked a lot with my friend David, he worked as a scientist and did great research, watching the eye movements of his cute rats every day, but unfortunately now because of the world conflict, we communicate less. I want more practice!
I have an upper elementary level of english(A1). I studied english throughout my education process in school and univercity and also by myself.
