      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>
        Flutter and Frontend developer. I love making cool visual stuff and
        refactoring my old code. In development I like to see results, create
        beautiful, user-friendly ui. Creating new products inspires me. During
        my internship at ENVX I worked in a team of 5 people in the roles of
        tester and flutter-trainee. I gained experience in code review, learned
        how to work on features in one repository in a project. In my spare time
        I run an Instagram blog, play chess, basketball and soccer, skateboard,
        and spend time with my loved ones. And of course with my cats!
